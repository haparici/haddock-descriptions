@phdthesis{loughnane:2009,
	Abstract = {This thesis describes the features of the phonology, morphology and syntax of Oksapmin, a Papuan (Non-Austronesian) language of Papua New Guinea. Oksapmin is spoken by around 8000 people, most of whom reside in the Tekin valley in Sandaun Province.  The analysis in this thesis is based on the study of data from both elicitation and text collection undertaken on two field trips between 2004 and 2006: from May to October 2004, and from October 2005 to January 2006.  A general introduction is provided in Chapter 1, phonology, phonotactics and morphophonology are discussed in Chapter 2, word classes in Chapter 3, demonstratives in Chapter 4, nouns in Chapter 5, postpositions in Chapter 6, noun phrase syntax in Chapter 7, verbs in Chapter 8, coverbs in Chapter 9, clausal syntax in Chapter 10, phrasal clitics in Chapter 11, and clause combining in Chapter 12. Four sample texts are provided as appendices.  Sound files are provided on the accompanying CD for many of the examples scattered throughout the thesis, as well as for all the texts in the appendices.  The most interesting and important grammatical subsystem in Oksapmin is the evidential one, which permeates various areas of the grammar.  Without proper knowledge of this system, one cannot make a single grammatical sentence in the language.  Recall that evidentiality is, roughly speaking, when a speaker marks how he or she came about the knowledge on which a given utterance is based.  Evidentiality in Oksapmin is indicated with past tense verbal inflection, with enclitics, and with a number of other constructions.  The evidential system is typologically unusual in that the primary contrast it marks is participatory/factual versus visual/sensory evidence; this distinction is made in the verbal inflection.  Participatory/factual evidentials are not widely attested cross-linguistically, and those systems that do exist have been largely ignored in the typological literature.  Some of the other areas of grammar discussed in this thesis include prenasalised consonants with nasal allophones, noun phrases with a complex syntactic structure, a range of demonstratives which distinguish for elevation, a large vocabulary of kin terms including a set of dyadic kin terms, extensive use of complex predicates consisting of a light verb plus a coverb, and a variety of clause combining strategies including clause chaining.},

  He proposes a parameterized Visibility Condition (from {\em
  Barriers}), such that Hungarian {\em that}-Clauses need to be in a
  CHAIN with case in order to be visible for theta-marking, whereas
  English {\em that}-clauses don't have to.  (This does not explain
  why we get {\em that}-Clauses in the absence of any accusative
  marker.)  (2) He proposes that in focus raising, the accusative case
  is ``transmitted'' to the clause (via a CHAIN, presumably), in order
  to satisfy the visibility condition.  (This leads to a contradiction
  if links on a CHAIN are supposed to be coindexed, and coindexation
  implies coreference, because the raised thing is not coreferent with
  the clause. (3) He states that (a) focus-raised elements are
  assigned case twice, and (b) the fact that nominative is unmarked is
  responsible for the fact that it can get accusative case from the
  matrix verb (yet he still says embedded-clause objects that
  focus-raise get accusative twice, even though accusative is not
  unmarked, so perhaps we can use haplology to explain that under his
  view).},

(1) Bridge verbs L-mark their CP complement. Evidence:
(a) obligatory absence of the "anticipatory pronoun"
(b) definiteness agreement suggests the raised things are governed by the matrix
verb (because the verbs then govern Spec,CP).  Explained if they're in Spec,CP
and CP is L-marked.
(c) the accusative case on raised subjects given to them by the matrix verb
indicates that the subjects are governed by the matrix verb, too.  Explained if
they're in Spec,CP and CP is L-marked.
(1) The raised thing goes successive-cyclically through Spec,CP, where it gets
accusative case.  Evidence:
(a) obligatory complementizer
(b) i. It lands somewhere:  lack of multiple long focus-movement: if one thing
has already gone through Spec,CP, then the next thing can't go through it. 
    ii. It's not the focus position: Wh-Islands can be extracted from, absence of
inversion with prefixes, (absence of long prefix movement but that argument
doesn't follow because it relies on the assumption that prefixes are in the
focus position which is convincingly argued against by Szendroi).

Alternatively, if gaps in adjunct phrase are possible, but are pronominal (Cinque 1990, Postal 1998) and parasitic on the presence of a distinct gap in the modified phrase, then the GHFP need not be overriden. Rather, a pronominal SLASH element coindexed with the head daughter's SLASH element must be allowed as an option. We make no attempt to resolve these options here. Note further that specific head-adjunct phrases may be extraction `islands', in which case their adjunct daughter is constrained to be [ SLASH ]."  So they are not making any claims, but giving a formal way to do it, depending on what turns out to be right about extraction out of an adjunct.

non-factivity is a precondition for taking non-finite ({\em as} or
{\em to be}) complements.  Also
concerned with the lexical semantic determinants of finite versus
non-finite clause selection.  Argue for the importance of the
distinction between mental representation and discourse
representation verbs.  Mental representation verbs have to do with
belief, and include {\em realize}, {\em think}, {\em assume}, etc.
Discourse representation verbs have to do with public expression, and
include {\em say}, {\em assert}, {\em argue}, etc.  They claim that
discourse representation verbs are ungrammatical with non-finite
complements.  There are quite a few counterexamples to this claim:
{\em describe}, {\em characterize}, {\em mention}, {\em cite}, {\em
  introduce}, {\em label}, {\em paint}, and {\em portray} are all
verbs having to do with public expession which take non-finite {\em
  as} complements, and {\em declare} and {\em deem} take infinitival
complements.  Even {\em say} takes infinitival complements, in the
passive: {\em John is said to have been a great man.}
Another discourse representation verb that takes infinitival
complements is {\em repute}; this one also only occurs in passive
voice. While Thompson and Hay may have found a tendency, their
generalization does not seem to be correct.

@article{hackletal12,
	Abstract = {Quantifiers, unlike proper names or definite descriptions, cannot be given the semantics of referring expressions. This fact has triggered a long-standing debate in formal semantics and syntax as to the combinatorial means by which quantifiers are integrated into a sentence. The present paper contributes to this debate through an investigation of quantifier comprehension during real-time sentence processing. We present evidence showing that two potentially independent processes---the integration of a quantifier in object position and the resolution of antecedent-contained deletion (ACD)---are linked. Our data show, more specifically, that the resolution of a downstream ACD site is facilitated during real-time sentence processing if the upstream DP hosting the ACD site is quantificational but not if it is definite. We discuss these findings in the context of a QUANTIFIER RAISING-based approach and a type-shifting-based approach to quantifier integration. We argue that facilitation of ACD resolution by an upstream quantifier is only expected by theories, such as the QUANTIFIER RAISING approach, which employ the same mechanism for both processes. We then compare the QUANTIFIER RAISING-based account with a non-grammatical experience-based approach to our data, which attempts to explain the findings in terms of corpus frequencies. Although we cannot rule out such an alternative at this stage, we offer reasons to believe that an account that exploits QUANTIFIER RAISING has an explanatory advantage.},

@article{szabolcsi14,
	Abstract = {Hackl et al. (2012) argue that processing evidence specifically supports a theory of Antecedent Contained Deletion (ACD) that involves the threat of type-mismatch and infinite regress, with Quantifier Raising (QR) coming to the rescue. This squib argues that the processing evidence does not specifically support that theory. Very similar predictions can be made by the variable-free, or combinatory, theory that Hackl et al. dismiss, if we add the assumption that ACD is resolved by binding, not by simple anaphora.},
