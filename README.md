# haddock_descriptions


##About this repo:

    -You can modify the `haddock_descriptions_paper.Rnw` file to make any changes to the R code or LaTeX 
    -The webppl model is in `haddock_model.wppl`. Please do not make any changes to that file. Create your own copy if you wanna play with it
    -I sue the file `test_haddock.wppl' to troubleshoot and try things out. It only runs one visual context at a time
    -`haddock_clean_data.csv' contains the data from (deanonymized) participants from MTutk and Prolific  

##Some guidelines to ease the writing process:

    -Do not push the output pdf to master. I have not included PDF in the `.gitignore`, but we could eventually do that it's easier
    -Let's coordinate on what sections of the paper each of us will work on so that we avoid conflicts
    -I have read that writing every sentence in new line helps, we can try it
